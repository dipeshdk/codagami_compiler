Native Data types :integer, float, character, (void*)
Variables and Expressions:

Control structures:
    Conditionals: if, if-else, ternary, switch case
    Loops: for, while, do-while
Input/Output statements:
    scanf, printf
Arrays:
    array of native data types, mutlidimension array, 
    array of structs, array initialization while declaration
Functions:
    Recursion, mutual resursion, function declaration, 
    function with return type as struct, function with parameter type as struct

Structs:
    function with return type as struct, function with parameter type as struct
    Struct dereference with both dot(.) operator and arrow(->) operator
User defined types (struct):
    no constructor
Pointers (single level / stack pointers):
    single level pointers allowed
Simple library functions:
    math functions: 


Extra: 
Dynamic memory allocation/management:
    malloc, 
    TODO: free
Code optimizations:
    First six parameters of functions in registers
    Short circuit eval in 3ac // maybe: and asm
    TODO: Check optimized goto's
    Constant evaluation (except float)
    Functions with more than 6 parameters
    basic features mentioned above supported for float as well


Specifications:
    All data types are 8 bytes (Padding ?)
    Explicit typecasting 
    Implicit typecasting with warning
    Function parameter check before calling
    Nested structs not supported
    only double precision floating point
    Prefix and postfix imcrement and decrement supported
    Sizeof function supported for identifiers and type name
    pointer arthimetic is absolute: int *a, *a = *a + 1 increments value by 1 not 8
    ellipsis operator not supported
    global data supported
    string literals are const
    struct declaration inside functions
    Nested scopes
    Global variables initialization with constants only
    switch case

compiler extra features:
    print symbol table scope wise in json format
    .s assembly generated
    .tac contains corresponding 3AC Code
    .dot to view ast

NOT supported:
    unsigned
    enum
    union
    type qualifier: const volatile
    storage classes specifiers
    not constants string literals


TODO: not tested
    Opmod 
    assignment expression
    relop
    struct declaration inside functions
    switch case
